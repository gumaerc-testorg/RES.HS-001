## **Blackbody Properties**

**Overview:** Students discover that they can determine sizes of stars, if they are modeled accurately by blackbodies.

- Lecture Tutorials on Introductory Astronomy (Adams, et al.): Tutorial on blackbody properties: Students read and complete the hot plate questions and luminosity questions, continuing to Part II about stars and the HR diagram.
- Introduce the HR diagram with the sizes of stars represented. 
- Introduce the relation for a spherical blackbody: L= sigma \* T4\*4pi\*R2, which relates the luminosity (L in Watts= Joules/sec), temperature (T, in Kelvin) and Radius ofthespherical blackbody (R in meters). Sigma= Stefan-Boltzmann constant = 5.67 x 10-8 Joules / (seconds x meters2 x Kelvin4) 
    - Image of notes about this relationship: ([HR diagram example](https://old.ocw.mit.edu/high-school/physics/chandra-astrophysics-institute/investigation-3-production-of-light/image-gallery-3/MITHFH_chandra_inv3_HR_dia.jpg), [LTR relationship](https://old.ocw.mit.edu/high-school/physics/chandra-astrophysics-institute/investigation-3-production-of-light/image-gallery-3/MITHFH_chandra_inv3_LTR_re.jpg))

**Teacher tips/tricks:**

- Timing: about 1 hour for lecture-tutorial alone

**Assessment:**

- Compare temperatures and/or sizes of other pairs of objects on HR diagram.
- Ask students to read off properties of selected stars on the HR diagram.
